# APIs

## API stands for: Application Programming Interface

It is a set of rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It can be any software that performs a specific task and the interface is a point where two applications communicate.

## Why is everyone using APIs?!

APIs are extremely beneficial to the development of applications and services, as well as the integration and management of existing ones.

## Types of APIs

## Certain protocols have been developed to provide users with a set of API **specifications**, that create accepted data types, commands and syntax. The protocols facilitate standardized information exchange.
### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): Built with XML, SOAP enables and the sending and receiving of data through SMTP and HTTP. SOAP APIs make it make it easier to share information between apps or software components that are running in multiple environments and different languages.

### REST(Representational State Transfer): REST is a way for two computer/programs to communicate with each other. They can receive, delete, edit or send information to the server. 
### The six guiding principles or Constraints of REST are:

* Uniform Interface
* Client-Server
* Stateless
* Cacheable
* Layered architecture
* Code on demand (optional).

## Suppose we have an API where we want to log in and order some goods, the API deployed on many servers can serve many requests, even from the same account without storing the authentication details or provided token state.

## Every time client is making a request it will send the authentication details as well as the other required information and that request can be processed easily at the server side as it includes all the information needed to fulfill the request.

## Caching is the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path.

## What is **HTTP**?

### Hypertext Transport (or Transfer) Protocol, the data transfer protocol used on the World Wide Web. 


## So, how does it work? 

APIs work by using a **protocol** which is a set of rules which computers follow to communicate. On the web, we use the HTTP protocol which you might have spotted in the url of every website.

## 5 HTTP verbs and what they do: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which are used to retrieve, create, update, and delete resources
